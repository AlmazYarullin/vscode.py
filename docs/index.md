# Welcome to vscode-ext

Create vscode extensions and color themes with python.

## Why use this?

Why should you use this for building VScode extensions when you can use typescript? Here are some reasons:

- vscode-ext builds the package.json for you! No need to switch between your extension.py and package.json in order to add commands. It also handles adding Activity Bars, Keybinds and Views.
- vscode-ext provides a more pythonic way of creating the extension. Python also has some powerful modules that Javascript doesn't and you can include these with vscode-ext
- vscode-ext extensions work perfectly with vsce and you can publish your extensions just like you would publish any other extension.

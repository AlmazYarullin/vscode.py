## with pip <small>recommended</small>

The latest stable release of vscode.py can be installed with `pip`:

```
pip install vscode.py
```

However if you want the latest working version from github you can:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/codewithswastik/vscode.py.git
```

## with git

vscode.py can be directly used from [GitHub][1] by cloning the
repository which might be useful if you want to use the working version:

```
git clone https://github.com/codewithswastik/vscode.py.git
```
